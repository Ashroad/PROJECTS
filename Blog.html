                <p>So you've finally decided to become a blogger; great, where should you start from??
                    <strong>No Panic!</strong><br> This blog post has got you covered on everything you'll need to become a professional web-blogger
                </p>

                <h4>What will you need?</h4>
                Apart from your basic knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS), you will need:
                <ol>
                    <li>A code editor (that's obvious right??</li>
                    <li>BULMA css framework</li>
                    <li>Lots and lots of time.</li>
                </ol>
                <br> So, you think you're ready? let's jump right in!! Hey, good morning, Mr. Eastwood! Morning. Have a cigar, Mr. Eastwood. Anything I can do for you today, Mr. Eastwood? No, no, it's... fine. Man #3 Good luck tomorrow, Mr. Eastwood!
                We'll be prayin' for ya! Hook on! (The gang connect their hoverboards to Griff's. Marty is trying to move, he's pushing his foot in the water as if trying to start a skateboard.) Batter up! (The board blasts off. Griff and his gang are
                on the way! Marty tries pushing the board again, but it doesn't work. Griff is getting closer. Then, just as Griff would have got Marty, Marty jumps off the board and lands in the water. Griff's board catches on a rock and Griff and his
                gang all fall off. They fly through the air and smash through the front window of Courthouse Mall. Marty resurfaces.) Holy shit! (He grabs the hoverboard and gets out of the water. Cut to Biff.) Buttheads.C'mon. Leave her alone, you bastard.
                You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well c'mon, this ain't no peep show. (The guys drag Marty off.) (Back of the Auditorium)Had you not interceded, Emmett might have been shot! Marty...uh, Clint...I'm going to take Clara
                home. (Before Marty can reply he's pulled aside by another man.) You sure set him straight, Mr. Eastwood. I'm glad somebody finally got the gumption to stand up to that son-of-a-bitch. You're alright in my book, Mr. Eastwood...I'd like
                to buy you a drink.Because I used it on Jennifer there wasn't enough power left to knock your son out for the full hour. Damn! (USA Today) Doc, Doc, Doc, look at this, it's changing! (The newspaper is changing from “Youth Arrested” to
                “Gang Arrested”. The picture of Marty Jr. changes to one of Griff and his gang.) (Courthouse) (Griff and his gang are led away by the cops. Doc looks at them through his futuristic binoculars.)
